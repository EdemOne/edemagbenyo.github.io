### Ever got stuck with where to get good questions for your next reactjs interview?

During my search for good interview questions on reactjs, i stumbled over this good [repo](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions#what-is-react) created by [@sudheerj](https://github.com/sudheerj) . 

In this repo you will find a total of 314 questions on reactjs. Each question is followed by a well detailed answer that might save you a lot of time.
The questions range from basic reactjs features defining what react and JSX are to advanced topics such as render props.
There are also questions on redux, react-router, i18n and a bit of react native.

If you are preparing for your next reactjs interview i recommend checking it out.
