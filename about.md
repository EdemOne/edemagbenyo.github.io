I am Edem Agbenyo. I am a fullstack software developer. My stack is [PHP]Laravel and NodeJS for backend and ReactJs and VueJs for frontend development. 

I have created this blog to talk more about my experience of being a software engineer and the hurdles i face and how i overcome them daily.

I will also be writing about new emerging technologies from a beginner perspective as i also consider myself an eternal beginner.
